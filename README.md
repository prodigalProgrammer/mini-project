## Description

This was a mini project on the course I was taking. We were tasked to clone the landing page and write the code to accompany it. Find the link to the webpage here: https://prodigalprogrammer.github.io/mini-project/

## Usage

This landing page has a navigation bar along with a cool main area and contact form for users to input their information. Lastly there is a footer displaying information about the company.

## Features

- Website created without any flex or grid properties. Old School!
- Header has a fixed position throughout the page.
- Hover cursor on Nav links & Send Button.
- Nav links change color when hovered over.
- Submit button disabled as to not redirect away from website.
- Button looks like it presses down when clicked.
- Form made with text and email inputs. Label elements are connected.
- Created an img tag with caption and alt attribute.
- Link in img caption take you to my YouTube channel.
